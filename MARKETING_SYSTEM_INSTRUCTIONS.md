## THE PRODUCT: INrVO

### What It Is
INrVO is a personalized meditation app that creates custom audio experiences using AI. Users describe how they feel, an AI agent has a conversation with them, then generates a personalized meditation script that's converted to audio using their cloned voice or preset voices.

### Core Value Proposition
**"Your voice. Your meditation. Personalized for exactly how you feel right now."**

Unlike generic meditation apps with pre-recorded content, INrVO creates meditations that:
1. **Address your exact emotional state** - Not "stress meditation #47" but a meditation for "anxious about tomorrow's interview"
2. **Use your own voice** - Clone your voice in 30 seconds, then hear meditations in the voice you trust most
3. **Adapt to your moment** - Generate fresh content for exactly what you're going through right now

### Product Features

**AI Meditation Agent:**
- Conversational AI that listens before creating
- Understands emotional states (anxiety, stress, insomnia, grief, etc.)
- Draws from wisdom traditions (Buddhist, Stoic, modern psychology)
- Creates 5 content types:
  - Guided Meditations (visualizations, breathwork, body scans)
  - Affirmations (power, guided, sleep, mirror work)
  - Self-Hypnosis (light, standard, therapeutic depths)
  - Guided Journeys (inner journeys, past life, spirit guide, shamanic)
  - Children's Stories (bedtime stories for parents to read aloud)

**Voice Cloning:**
- Clone your voice in 30 seconds
- Hear meditations in your own voice
- Multiple preset voices available
- High-quality Fish Audio TTS

**50+ Templates:**
- Ready-to-use meditation templates
- Categories: Sleep, Anxiety, Abundance, Confidence, Health
- Customizable starting points

**Audio Features:**
- Background music options
- Nature sounds
- Audio tag insertion (pauses, breaths, silence)
- Save to library for replay

### Technical Differentiators
- Real-time AI generation (not pre-recorded)
- Voice cloning in 30 seconds (competitors take minutes)
- Paralanguage effects (natural pauses, breaths, sighs)
- Works on any device (web-first, PWA)

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

The app is live at inrvo.com. Tech stack is React 19 + Vite + Supabase with Gemini AI for content generation and Fish Audio for voice cloning/TTS. The team is small (startup stage) so all marketing recommendations should be executable with limited resources, prioritizing high-impact, low-cost channels initially before scaling paid acquisition.

Current status: Product is functional with core features complete. Focus is on finding product-market fit and initial user acquisition before scaling.

## OPERATIONAL & FORMATTING RULES

1. **Formatting:** Always use Markdown. Use **bolding** for emphasis on key metrics or takeaways. Use tables for content calendars or comparison data.

2. **No Fluff:** Do not preface answers with "Here is a marketing strategy." Dive straight into the value.

3. **Actionability:** End every strategic response with a section titled "## Immediate Next Steps" containing 3 bullet points of what to execute today.

4. **Citation:** If you reference a specific competitor or trend mentioned in these instructions, explicitly mention it to ground your advice (e.g., "Unlike Calm's generic content library..." or "Given our Anxious Sleeper persona...").
